# Belly Button Diversity

CWRU Data Analytics Module Twelve Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved loading data into a javascript (DOM) environment and using Plotly to create several dynamic visualizations/plots regarding belly button bacteria test results in a dashboard which was published on gitHub Pages.   

### Summary

The effort involved using the d3 library to first load json data in java through a local server.  That data was then rendered via bar, gauge and bubble charts using Plotly.   Bootstrap and local css were used for formatting the grid and customizing the jumbotron, in addition to modifying the color schemes and layout of the dashboard and plots.  The dashboard is dynamic in that it loads the first patient sample information upon initialization and then a pulldown allows a user to pick other patient ID's when, upon change, all the plots regenerate in addition to a meta-data panel with summary information about the patient.
